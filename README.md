# 49ers_2023

This is a space where I'm practicing my data analysis and visualization for fun. I found an open data source for NFL play data (kindly sourced here: https://github.com/nflverse/nflverse-data/releases/tag/pbp) and grabbed the most recent year, 2023. I haven't yet played around with any specific packages made for NFL analytics yet, but I hope to. I started this project primarily because I wanted to practice coding and data viz but applied to a dataset that I actually enjoyed. I sought data I would love to dive into (for my favorite NFL team!!) hoping this would motivate me to enjoy my work. Call it the baby steps of a passion project. Currently using plotly for interactive plots, but I am considering learning reporting tools like Tableau for dashboards. Alternatively, I could try to build a shiny dashboard. We'll see! 

Major question: Does Brock Purdy from the 49ers actually benefit more from yards after catch (YAC) than other quarterbacks (QB) in the league? 

Some general future goals for this exploratory analysis: investigate YAC with other variables like distance of the pass, quarter, home or away game, etc. and clean up the visualizations so they're easily interpretable and pretty. Eventually I'll also need to do this for the other QBs for comparison.
